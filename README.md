# School Shooting Incident Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict outcomes of school shooting incidents, utilizing a comprehensive dataset from the "Public K-12 School Shooting Database." The dataset includes detailed information on incidents, shooters, victims, and weapons from 1966 to 2023.

## Objectives
- To uncover patterns and trends in school shooting incidents.
- To predict victim outcomes using machine learning models.
- To provide insights for policy interventions and preventive strategies in schools.

## Data Analysis
- **Dataset**: Public K-12 School Shooting Database.
- **Period**: 1966 to 2023.
- **Analysis**: Extensive exploratory data analysis to identify significant trends, especially a rise in incidents post-2016 and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing**: Comprehensive cleaning and preprocessing of the dataset.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
- **Feature Selection and Optimization**: Focused on enhancing model accuracy and performance.

## Results
- **Model Performance**: SVM outperformed Logistic Regression in accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score.
- **Insights**: Identification of temporal and geographical trends, school types most affected, and common characteristics of perpetrators.

## Conclusion
The project highlights the critical need for preventive measures and policy changes in school environments to mitigate such incidents. The insights and methodologies can contribute to the development of more effective safety measures in schools.
